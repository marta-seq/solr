**2.4 Applications of Spatial Omics in Cancer and Beyond**

Spatial omics are accelerating insights into tissue biology and
transforming multiple areas of medicine. In particular, they have been
extensively applied to study complex microenvironments, such as tumours,
where spatial context and cellular heterogeneity are critical and often
obscured in bulk or single-modality data (49,67--69). They have also
been used to study clonality differences in space (70,71). While the
applications are vast and rapidly evolving, they are reviewed in detail
elsewhere (49,67--69).

With this foundation in the underlying technologies and their biological
potential, the next section shifts focus to the analytical challenges
and computational frameworks required to interpret and integrate spatial
omics data.
