These have effectively revealed key mutations, epigenetic changes, and dysregulated pathways within various tumor types.</p> <p>More recently, multi-omics strategies (including epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) have significantly expanded our understanding of tumor biology by capturing additional layers of molecular regulation. Further revolutionizing the field, single-cell technologies have enabled the detailed  dissection of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, identifying rare cell populations and lineage trajectories  that bulk analyses often obscure. These advancements have even extended to single-cell proteomics and metabolomics, offering increasingly comprehensive insights into tumor ecosystems.</p> <p>Despite their immense power, a critical limitation of many of these cutting-edge omics methods is their lack of spatial context. They tell us what molecular components or cell types are present, but not where they are located or how they interact within the intricate tissue microenvironment. This spatial information is essential for understanding disease progression and treatment response.</p> <p>In clinical settings, spatial information is routinely obtained through methods like histopathological staining (e.g., H&amp;E), immunohistochemistry, and radiological imaging.  While vital for diagnosis and clinical decision-making, these approaches typically offer  spatial resolution at the tissue or organ level.  They are inherently limited in molecular detail and throughput, lacking the capacity to resolve  cellular heterogeneity or dynamic molecular interactions at a fine scale.</p> <p>To overcome these limitations and integrate high-resolution molecular profiling with precise spatial localization, spatial omics technologies have emerged. These powerful tools allow for the direct  mapping of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites within their native tissue context.  By preserving the original architecture of tumors and their microenvironments, spatial  omics provides a more complete and insightful picture of biological processes.</p> <p>The following chapters aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of spatial omics workflows,  covering topics from:</p> <ul> <li>Spatially Resolved Omics Techniques</li> <li>Technical Overview<ul> <li>Preprocessing</li> <li>Cell Segmentation</li> <li>Phenotyping</li> <li>Neighborhood Analysis</li> <li>Domain Identification</li> <li>Spatially Variable Genes</li> <li>Functional Analysis</li> <li>Sample Condition Distinctions</li> <li>Frameworks and tools</li> <li>Closing remarks</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"book/chapter1/","title":"Spatially Resolved Omics Techniques","text":"<p>Spatial omics technologies have the potential to advance our understanding of tumour ecosystems and improve clinical outcomes.

Most spatial proteomics techniques detect proteins using antibodies tagged with fluorophores, metals, or DNA barcodes. These tags are then read using technologies such as fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry, or DNA-based imaging to map the spatial distribution of proteins within tissues [1-5]. A summary of key features across these technologies is provided in Table1.</p> <p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is one of the most established clinical tools for protein detection [6]. It uses enzyme-linked antibodies to generate a chromogenic signal visible under brightfield microscopy. While widely available and routinely used in diagnostics, traditional IHC is generally limited to detecting one or a few markers per tissue section, making it unsuitable for high-dimensional spatial profiling.</p> <p>Among the fluorescence-based approaches, Immunofluorescence (IF) [7] is widely used but limited in multiplexing. More advanced cyclic immunofluorescence methods, such as tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) [8] and IBEX [9], use iterative staining and imaging cycles to overcome spectral limitations, enabling the detection of 40-60+ markers with spatial resolution down to 200-300 nm.</p> <p>DNA-barcoded approaches such as CODEX [10] and Immuno-SABER [11] further enhance multiplexing. CODEX utilizes DNA-barcoded antibodies and sequential hybridization of fluorescent probes, achieving high multiplexing (up to 60 proteins) with single-cell resolution (\u223c500 nm) in a single imaging plane [12]. Immuno-SABER employs orthogonal DNA concatemers for signal amplification achieving 32-plex with same resolution as COSMX [11].</p> <p>Mass spectrometry-based approaches, notably Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) [13] and multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) [14], use antibodies conjugated to isotopically pure lanthanide metals, which are detected using laser ablation (IMC) or ion beams (MIBI-TOF). These methods avoid fluorescence background and allow simultaneous quantification of 40-50 proteins per tissue section. IMC offers spatial resolution of approximately 1 \u03bcm, while MIBI achieves higher resolution (\u223c300 nm), albeit with more complex instrumentation.</p> <p>Table1-Comparison table of key features of spatial proteomics profiling methods.</p> Method Tag Type Detection Multiplexing Capacity Resolution Resolution Scale IHC Enzyme(chromogen) BrightfieldMicroscopy 1--2 ~1--5 \u00b5m Cellular IF Fluorophore FluorescenceMicroscopy 4--7 ~200--500 nm Subcellular cyCIF / 4i / IBEX Fluorophore(iterative) Cyclic FluorescenceImaging &gt;60 ~250 nm Subcellular CODEX DNA Barcode FluorescenceMicroscopy &gt;40--60+ ~250 nm Subcellular Immuno-SABER DNA Barcode(concatemers) FluorescenceMicroscopy &gt;50+ ~200--300 nm Subcellular IMC Metal Isotopes Laser Ablation+ MS ~40 ~1 \u00b5m Cellular MIBI Metal Isotopes Ion Beam+ MS ~40 ~300 nm Subcellular <p>Together, these spatial proteomics platforms offer complementary advantages in terms of marker throughput, resolution, and sensitivity, enabling comprehensive characterization of the tumour microenvironment, immune cell infiltration, and cellular architecture in situ.</p>"},{"location":"book/chapter1/#spatial-transcriptomics","title":"Spatial transcriptomics","text":"<p>Spatial transcriptomics enables the study of gene expression within the tissue architecture, preserving spatial context at cellular or subcellular resolution.

MERFISH [18] uses combinatorial labelling and error-correcting barcodes to detect thousands of RNA species in single cells. Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (seqFISH)+ [19] leverages sequential rounds of hybridization with an expanded pseudo-color palette, enabling detection of over 10,000 genes at subcellular resolution.</p> <p>Commercial platforms such as CosMx (Nanostring/Bruker Spatial) [18], MERscope (Vizgen), and Xenium (10x Genomics) [20] implement these strategies to achieve high-resolution imaging of hundreds to thousands of RNA species, often with optional co-detection of proteins.</p>"},{"location":"book/chapter1/#in-situ-sequencing-imaging-based-approaches","title":"In situ sequencing Imaging-Based Approaches","text":"<p>ISS techniques sequence RNA molecules directly within tissues, preserving both spatial context and nucleotide identity.

Following this, normalization is applied-most commonly scaling gene counts to 10,000 per cell and applying a log-transformation-to standardize data across cells. Since these datasets are high-dimensional, dimensionality reduction is used to make the data more manageable. Principal Component analysis (PCA) is commonly applied first to identify the most informative gene expression patterns. For visualization and further analysis, nonlinear techniques like t-SNE and  UMAP are used to project the data into two or three dimensions while preserving its underlying structure [38].</p> <p>Next, clustering algorithms group similar cells together. This is usually done by building a KNN graph in the PCA-reduced space. Each cell is connected to its K most similar neighbours, and clustering algorithms such as Louvain [39] and Leiden [40], often with better performance [41] are applied to identify densely connected communities within the graph.

In practice, this can be done by checking whether known markers are expressed in each cluster or, conversely, by identifying differentially expressed genes within clusters and matching them to known biological signatures. While manual annotation is transparent and interpretable, it can be subjective, labour-intensive, and limited by the availability and specificity of known markers [38].</p> <p>Alternatively, automated annotation methods are also available, which leverage reference gene atlases and machine/deep learning models (e.g., CellTypist [42]), or label transfer approaches (e.g., Symphony [43]).

Additionally, many spatial datasets do not align well with existing reference atlases due to differences in tissue context, resolution, or platform. As a result, manual annotation remains more reliable and commonly used in spatial transcriptomics, particularly when high-resolution spatial context and known marker expression are available.</p>"},{"location":"book/chapter2/#cellular-neighbourhood-analysis","title":"Cellular neighbourhood analysis","text":"<p>Cellular neighbourhood analysis begins with the construction of a spatial connectivity graph that captures the proximity relationships between cells within the tissue. This spatial graph serves as the backbone for downstream spatial statistics and interaction analyses. Different methods can be used to construct such graphs, including k-nearest neighbours, where each cell is connected to a fixed number of closest neighbours; radius-based expansion, which connects all cells within a given physical distance; and Delaunay triangulation, which uses geometric criteria to define adjacency without imposing arbitrary thresholds. Importantly, the same principles and methodologies for neighbourhood analysis apply across these two modalities, despite differences in the underlying molecular readouts [6,38].</p> <p>Once a graph is established, it enables the exploration of spatial interactions between annotated cell types. A common approach involves the computation of neighbourhood enrichment scores, which statistically test whether specific cell types are found adjacent to each other more or less frequently than expected by chance. These analyses rely on permutation-based null models, which shuffle cell-type labels while preserving tissue structure, providing a robust statistical framework to assess enrichment or depletion of interactions [44]. Another related method is the computation of co-occurrence scores, which estimate how likely it is to observe specific cell-type pairs within increasing radii around each cell. These scores reflect the conditional probability of observing a certain cell type given the presence of another nearby, offering an interpretable measure of spatial association across scales [38].</p> <p>Alternatively, simple interaction matrices can be computed, summarizing the raw counts of neighbouring cell-type pairs [6]. Though not statistical tests, these matrices are useful for exploratory data analysis.</p> <p>Beyond pairwise interaction analyses, more integrative approaches aim to cluster cells based on the composition of their local neighbourhoods. One strategy involves computing, for each cell, the fraction of surrounding cell types within its local environment (e.g., 20 nearest neighbours). These local composition profiles can then be clustered using unsupervised methods such as k-means or Leiden algorithms, grouping cells into recurring spatial neighbourhoods. This approach was introduced by studies such as Goltsev et al. [45] and Sch\u00fcrch et al. [46], which revealed that specific combinations of neighbouring discrete cell types are often spatially organized in conserved patterns.</p> <p>A related method involves aggregating gene or protein expression features across the neighbourhood, effectively capturing a summary of the local microenvironment. These aggregated features can then serve as the basis for clustering or downstream modelling, this is approach is implemented for example in covariance environment (COVET) [47], NicheCompass, a graph deep-learning approach to identify and quantitatively characterize niches by learning cell embeddings encoding signalling events as spatial gene program activities [48] and Banksy [49].</p> <p>Through these computational strategies, spatial neighbourhoods can be identified and interpreted biologically as spatial niches-localized, recurring configurations of cells and their molecular environment that reflect functionally relevant tissue microenvironments.

While cellular neighbourhoods capture the immediate microenvironment around a cell-defined by local interactions and spatial proximity-spatial domains extend this concept to larger anatomical or functional areas of tissue. These regions often consist of diverse cell types and multiple neighbourhood configurations, working together to support complex biological functions.</p> <p>Because of the overlap between microenvironmental patterns and larger spatial structures, some computational approaches can identify both neighbourhoods and domains using similar principles. These methods generally integrate molecular profiles with spatial information, allowing for the detection of both fine-grained and broader-scale tissue organization. A common strategy involves combining a cell's individual gene or protein expression with the aggregated expression from its surrounding neighbours. This allows the model to capture both intrinsic cell identity and the influence of the local microenvironment, which is particularly useful in tissues where cells of the same type are dispersed rather than spatially clustered.</p> <p>A wide range of computational strategies has been developed for domain segmentation. Some early methods relied on spatial smoothing techniques, such as Markov Random Fields, which encourage physically proximate cells to be assigned the same label [50,51]. This assumes that a cell's transcriptome resembles the average of its domain, although this may not always hold true in tissues where multiple cell types are intermixed. Other approaches employ deep learning, particularly graph-based neural networks that can incorporate either histological information [52,53] or spatial graphs derived purely from molecular and positional data [54-56]. These methods offer flexibility and can capture complex spatial dependencies, but their performance can vary with dataset size and structure.</p> <p>More recently, methods introducing hierarchical and multiscale representations of spatial structure have emerged. For instance, NeST [57] identifies nested co-expression hotspots-spatially contiguous regions that co-express subsets of genes-by simultaneously searching across gene and spatial dimensions. This approach captures biological structure at multiple scales and can reveal overlapping or nested domains, without requiring prior assumptions about gene sets or spatial resolution. Similarly, the concept of tissue schematics [58] has been proposed as a way to abstract spatial organization into higher-order motifs, by identifying modular assemblies of cellular neighbourhoods. These schematics can be used to represent tissue architecture in both healthy and diseased states, offering insights into how local interactions scale up to tissue-level functionality.</p>"},{"location":"book/chapter2/#spatially-variable-genes","title":"Spatially Variable genes","text":"<p>Spatially Variable genes (SVG)s are genes whose expression displays significant spatial patterning across a tissue.

Notably, SVG detection does not rely on cell segmentation, making it applicable across different spatial omics technologies.</p> <p>Several computational methods have been developed to detect SVGs by decomposing gene expression variability into spatial and non-spatial components. A widely used statistic is Moran's I, which quantifies spatial autocorrelation by measuring how similar gene expression is between neighbouring spots [59]. Model-based approaches like SpatialDE [60], trendseek [61], SPARK [62], and SPARK-X [63] use Gaussian processes or spatial statistical models to test for spatially structured expression while accounting for noise and overdispersion. While these tools test each gene independently and return p-values, they often overlook spatial domain context, which can limit biological interpretability. Other strategies take different modelling perspectives: Sepal [64] applies a Gaussian diffusion process, scGCO [65] uses graph cuts to detect spatial expression boundaries, and SpaGCN [53], defines both domains and SVGs integrating histology and spatial proximity through graph convolutional networks.</p> <p>Importantly, the identification of SVGs is modality-agnostic and applicable to both spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics.

Broadly, these methods fall into two sections: identifying pairs of genes that interact, such that expression of the gene in one cell influences that of the other gene in others; and identifying pairs of cells in which that gene pair interacts [77].</p> <p>Most methods for CCC leverage ligand\u2013receptor (L-R) interactions, relying heavily on prior biological knowledge, often curated into  databases such as CellPhoneDB [69], OmniPath [78], and CellChat [70]. These databases catalogue known signalling pathways and interaction pairs from the literature. Using such resources, CCC inference can be extended to the spatial context by identifying L-R pairs co-expressed in nearby cells [67] for example using spatial co-expression [67, 73], or incorporating different approaches such as optimal transport frameworks [72] or Bayesian multiple instance learning (MIL) [76] to more precisely link cells by both location and expression.</p> <p>Complementing these prior knowledge-driven approaches are data-driven methods that model spatial gene expression to discover novel interactions. These models, like NCEM [68], GCNG [75] or SVCA [79] and Misty [80] (while not specific for CCC), aim to capture interactions that explain spatial expression variance across multiple genes. They enable inference of new communication patterns not captured in curated L-R databases, though their accuracy depends on model design and training data.</p> <p>Furthermore, some CCC frameworks estimate global co-localization across entire tissue sections [68, 71, 80], and others focus on local cell-cell proximity [72,73].</p> <p>In parallel, there is increasing interest in inferring intracellular functional activity; such as pathway activation, TF activity, or gene set enrichment; within individual cells or regions. Tools like decouplR [81] apply prior knowledge from pathway perturbation signatures [82] or regulatory networks [83] to estimate these functional states at single-cell or spot level. As with CCC, these functional scores can then be spatially mapped. These approaches are currently more mature for spatial transcriptomics, where broader gene coverage enables more reliable functional inference. In contrast, spatial proteomics remains limited by smaller marker panels and less comprehensive prior knowledge, constraining the resolution of functional state estimation.</p> <p>While spatial omics provides a key advantage over single-cell RNA through direct measurement of cell proximity-eliminating the need for probabilistic neighbourhood modelling and enabling exclusion of implausible, long-range interactions-this often comes with trade-offs. Platforms with true cellular resolution (e.g., CosMx, Xenium) may capture fewer genes, complicating pathway-level analyses and downstream functional interpretation. Moreover, the heavy reliance on curated databases across most CCC methods introduces variability and potential inconsistencies, as predictions can differ significantly depending on the resource used.</p> <p>Ultimately, understanding how a cell's functional state is shaped by its environment; and how it, in turn, influences surrounding cells; is a central and still largely untapped frontier in spatial biology.
