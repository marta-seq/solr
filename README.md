# Spatial Omics Living Review

This repository serves as a living review for the field of spatial omics.
It aims to continuously update and curate relevant scientific literature, methodologies,
and resources within this rapidly evolving domain.

This project provides an interactive platform for exploring computational neuroscience papers. It leverages semantic similarity to build a dynamic graph, allowing researchers to discover connections, filter by various attributes, and delve into the methodologies discussed in the literature.

## About this Living Review

The field of spatial omics, encompassing techniques such as Spatial Transcriptomics,
Imaging Mass Cytometry, and more, generates vast amounts of data and new analytical approaches. A living review provides a dynamic platform to:

* **Track new publications:** Continuously identify and incorporate recently published papers.
* **Summarize key findings:** Provide concise overviews of important breakthroughs and methods.
* **Highlight emerging trends:** Identify and discuss new directions and technologies.
* **Curate resources:** Point to useful tools, software, datasets, and community initiatives.

The focus is on create a roadmap of the available methods to analyse spatial omics data and to
summarize the current spatial datasets available in the field.

The review is based on the scrap of pubmed, with papers being weakly annotated
by google LLMs to identify relevant papers and categorize methods/applications/tools.
The entries are then manually curated by the author.
